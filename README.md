> Sysnsilo goes to public beta from 04/17/2023.

SyncSilo is an application built by me, just to show off to a discord community that I can provide them a centralized storage system within 10 days of announcement. No joke, but I really wanted them to know I am a Full Stack Developer & offcourse show off that my user base primarily consits of global citizens.

Syncsilo is built on React.js with it's styling quickly brought together by bootstrap. It uses Firebase by Google as it's backend, fully utilizing the Web SDK provided by them. Hosted on Google servers, it is superfast & super easy to use.
